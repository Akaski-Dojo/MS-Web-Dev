# Instructions

Read the following code, try to understand it, and finally execute it properly with nodejs.

```javascript
// This is a comment, it doesn't affect the code execution.

function isEven(number) {
  return number % 2 === 0;
}

const startingPoint = 0;
const endingPoint = 100;

for(let i = startingPoint; i <= endingPoint; i++) {
  if(isEven(i)) {
    console.log("Even number: " + i);
  } else {
    console.log("Odd number: " + i);
  }
}
```

Next, write the same code in the following languages and make sure that it works properly.

- [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))
- [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))
- [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))

Finally, upload every file with its corresponding code in a folder called 'to-do-done"
